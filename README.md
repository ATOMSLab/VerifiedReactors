# KeYmaeraX_Project
This project was executed using KeYmaera X, a dedicated theorem prover developed for hybrid systems. To utilize it, [Download KeYmaera X](https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaeraX-release/releases/download/5.0.2/keymaerax.jar). Launch KeYmaera X by entering the command `java -jar keymaerax.jar` into your terminal. Once the application starts, load the desired model by clicking on the "New Model" button in the KeYmaera X interface.
Further information are available at [KeYmaera X](https://keymaerax.org/). Explore it for a deeper understanding and more effective use of the theorem prover.
